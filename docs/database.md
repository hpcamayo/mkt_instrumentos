# Database and Supabase

This document reflects the actual current migration files and TypeScript types, plus business expectations from Laria planning docs.

## Supabase Usage

Supabase is used for:
- Postgres database tables.
- Row Level Security policies.
- Supabase Auth for admin login and the Phase 2 seller/store-owner account foundation.
- Storage buckets for listing photos and store images.
- RPC functions for admin checking, account ownership checks, publication validation, and listing view count increments.

Environment variables used in current code:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

Important:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` should be only the base Supabase URL, for example `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`, not `/rest/v1/`.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is used only by `lib/supabase/admin-client.ts` for future server-side admin/invite actions.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` must stay server-only and must never be exposed to browser code or prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

## Current Tables

## Planning Docs vs Current Schema

Older Laria business docs describe the intended model in product language. The current code and migrations use slightly different names in a few places:
- Listing seller fields are `contact_name` and `whatsapp_phone`, not `seller_name` and `seller_whatsapp`.
- Listing photos live in `listing_photos.image_url`, not a `photos` array on `listings`.
- Listing-level `is_featured` and `is_verified` do not exist yet. Verification is currently store-level through `stores.is_verified`.
- Store WhatsApp is `whatsapp_phone`, not `whatsapp`.
- Store plan exists as `listing_plan`; there is no separate `listing_limit` column yet.
- Current instrument types include plural values for some groups: `microphones`, `pedals`, and `amplifiers`.

When in doubt, treat migration files and the live Supabase schema as the implementation source of truth. Planning names should only become schema names through an explicit migration and app update.

`lib/supabase/database.types.ts` includes the Phase 2 account tables, ownership fields, enums, and helper RPCs. Keep it aligned with later migrations. The PostgREST computed photo-count field uses explicit query result types because the SDK select parser does not infer computed columns.

### `public.profiles`

Purpose: one app-level profile per Supabase Auth user.

Added by `20260516180000_phase_2_accounts.sql`:
- `id uuid primary key references auth.users(id)`
- `full_name text`
- `phone text`
- `city text`
- `region text default 'Peru'`
- `account_type text default 'seller'`
- `created_at timestamptz`
- `updated_at timestamptz`

`account_type` is currently `seller`, `store_owner`, or `admin`. Admin authority still comes from Supabase Auth `app_metadata.role = "admin"`; profile `account_type` is app metadata, not the security boundary.

### `public.store_members`

Purpose: link store accounts to store records and support future multiple employees per store.

Added by `20260516180000_phase_2_accounts.sql`:
- `id uuid primary key`
- `store_id uuid references stores(id)`
- `user_id uuid references profiles(id)`
- `role text`
- `created_at timestamptz`

Roles are `owner`, `manager`, or `staff`. New stores with `owner_user_id` automatically create an owner membership.

### `public.stores`

Purpose: small music store profiles.

Actual columns represented in current code/types:
- `id uuid primary key`
- `name text not null`
- `slug text unique not null`
- `description text`
- `status store_status not null default 'pending'`
- `listing_plan store_listing_plan not null default 'free'`
- `contact_name text`
- `whatsapp_phone text not null`
- `city text not null`
- `region text not null default 'Peru'`
- `district text`
- `address text`
- `instagram_url text`
- `facebook_url text`
- `logo_url text`
- `banner_url text`
- `is_verified boolean not null default false`
- `owner_user_id uuid references profiles(id)` for Phase 2 store ownership
- `razon_social text`
- `ruc text`
- `contact_person text`
- `email text`
- `tiktok_url text`
- `website_url text`
- `rejection_reason text`
- `created_at timestamptz not null default now()`
- `updated_at timestamptz not null default now()`

Current behavior:
- Public store registration inserts `status='pending'` and `listing_plan='free'`.
- Public store pages only read `status='active'`.
- Verified stores are highlighted through `is_verified`.
- Phase 2 account-aware store applications can set `owner_user_id`; admin approval still controls public visibility and verification.

Future business expectations:
- Store plans may become monetized packages such as 20, 50, or 100 listings.
- Existing code still uses `name` and `whatsapp_phone`; do not introduce duplicate `store_name` or `whatsapp` columns unless a later migration intentionally renames the app model.

### `public.listings`

Purpose: marketplace product listings from individuals or stores.

Actual columns represented in current code/types:
- `id uuid primary key`
- `store_id uuid references stores(id) on delete set null`
- `seller_type seller_type not null`
- `status listing_status not null default 'pending'`
- `title text not null`
- `slug text unique not null`
- `description text`
- `category text not null`
- `brand text`
- `model text`
- `condition text`
- `price_pen integer`
- `instrument_type text`
- `attributes jsonb default '{}'::jsonb`
- `published_at timestamptz`
- `view_count integer default 0`
- `owner_user_id uuid references profiles(id)` for Phase 2 listing ownership
- `sold_at timestamptz`
- `archived_at timestamptz`
- `created_by_source text default 'legacy'`
- `marketplace_rules_accepted_at timestamptz`
- `city text not null`
- `region text not null default 'Peru'`
- `contact_name text`
- `whatsapp_phone text not null`
- `created_at timestamptz not null default now()`
- `updated_at timestamptz not null default now()`

Important constraints:
- `slug` must be lowercase URL-safe words separated by hyphens.
- `price_pen` must be non-negative when present.
- Individual listings must have `store_id is null`.
- Store listings must have `store_id is not null`.

Current behavior:
- Public pages only show `status='approved'`.
- New individual submissions enter as `pending`.
- Admin can set listing status to `approved`, `rejected`, `hidden`, or `sold`.
- Phase 2 account-aware listings can be owned by `owner_user_id`; legacy listings keep `owner_user_id=null` and continue to display through existing contact fields.
- `created_by_source` tracks `legacy`, `self_service`, `admin_invite`, or `admin`.
- `published_at` is used for newest sort and detail metadata. If null, detail metadata falls back to `created_at`.
- `view_count` is incremented by an RPC when detail pages are opened.
- Listing detail pages render `attributes` as user-facing specification rows through `lib/listing-specs.ts`, using labels/options from `lib/instrument-filters.ts`. Empty attributes are hidden and raw JSON should not be shown in the UI.
- Listing detail seller/store trust boxes count active approved listings by `store_id` for stores and by `whatsapp_phone` for individual sellers, because full seller accounts do not exist yet.
- Listing detail recommendation sections only read `status='approved'` listings. Similar listings exclude the current listing, prioritize the same `instrument_type` or category, and use `brand` as a secondary relevance signal. More-from-seller/store listings use `store_id` for stores and `whatsapp_phone` for individual sellers.

Important current gap:
- The public seller form does not yet collect `instrument_type` or `attributes`, although advanced filtering uses those fields.
- Individual seller listing counts are a best-effort contact-based signal until seller accounts exist.

### `public.listing_photos`

Purpose: image records for listings.

Actual columns:
- `id uuid primary key`
- `listing_id uuid not null references listings(id) on delete cascade`
- `image_url text not null`
- `alt_text text`
- `sort_order integer not null default 0`
- `created_at timestamptz not null default now()`
- `updated_at timestamptz not null default now()`

Current behavior:
- Browse pages embed only the first related photo.
- Cards fetch additional photos on demand from `/api/listings/[id]/photos`.
- Detail pages fetch the full relation and render main photo plus additional thumbnails.

## Enums

`seller_type`:
- `individual`
- `store`

`listing_status`:
- `draft`
- `pending`
- `approved`
- `rejected`
- `hidden`
- `sold`
- `archived`

`store_status`:
- `pending`
- `active`
- `hidden`
- `rejected`

`store_listing_plan`:
- `free`
- `starter_20`
- `growth_50`
- `pro_100`

Only `free` is used by the current public store registration flow.

## RLS Assumptions

RLS is enabled on:
- `profiles`
- `stores`
- `listings`
- `listing_photos`
- `store_members`

Public read policies:
- Active stores are readable by `anon` and `authenticated`.
- Approved listings are readable by `anon` and `authenticated`.
- Photos are readable when their listing is approved.

Public insert policies:
- Pending listings can be inserted by `anon` and `authenticated`.
- Pending free stores can be inserted by `anon` and `authenticated`.
- These legacy public insert policies are intentionally preserved until the account-aware form flow fully replaces them.

Account policies:
- Users can read and update their own profile; admins can read and update all profiles.
- Authenticated users can insert their own profile with `account_type='seller'` or `account_type='store_owner'`.
- Store owners/members can read their own stores and memberships.
- Authenticated users can insert their own pending store application with `owner_user_id=auth.uid()`.
- Store members can update store profile fields, but triggers block non-admin changes to protected fields such as `status`, `listing_plan`, `is_verified`, `rejection_reason`, and `owner_user_id`.
- Listing owners and store members can read/update their own manageable listings, but triggers block non-admin changes to protected listing fields such as `status`, `published_at`, `view_count`, `created_by_source`, `owner_user_id`, `store_id`, and `seller_type`.
- Approved store members can insert pending store listings.
- Listing managers can manage photo rows for listings they can manage.

Admin policies:
- Admin read/update policies depend on `public.is_admin()`.
- `is_admin()` checks `auth.jwt() -> 'app_metadata' ->> 'role' = 'admin'`.
- Admin users must be created in Supabase Auth and given `app_metadata.role = "admin"`.

## RPC Functions

`public.is_admin()`:
- Used by the admin panel to verify access.
- Used by RLS policies for admin reads/updates.

`public.listing_has_status(listing_id, expected_status)`:
- Security definer helper used by photo RLS to allow photo reads for approved listings.

`public.increment_listing_view_count(p_listing_id uuid)`:
- Security definer function for public view-count increments.
- Updates only approved listings.
- Returns the next `view_count`.

`public.is_store_member(store_id)`, `public.is_store_owner(store_id)`, and `public.is_approved_store_member(store_id)`:
- Security-definer helpers for account and store membership RLS.

`public.can_manage_listing(listing_id)`:
- Security-definer helper that allows admins, listing owners, and store members to manage a listing.

`public.listing_meets_publish_requirements(listing_id)`:
- Checks strict publication requirements for later self-service publishing: at least 3 photos, required brand/model/category/condition/location/contact fields, positive price, minimum description length, and accepted marketplace rules.

`public.submit_listing_for_publication(listing_id)`:
- Security-definer RPC for later app flows.
- Publishes valid individual-owner listings or valid approved-store-member listings by setting `status='approved'` and `published_at`.

## Storage Buckets

`listing-photos`:
- Public bucket.
- Max file size: 5 MB.
- Allowed MIME types: JPEG, PNG, WebP.
- Public select and insert policies.
- Public listing submissions upload to paths like `pending/{listingId}/{n}-{uuid}.{ext}`.
- Phase 2 adds authenticated owner-folder upload support for future paths like `{auth.uid()}/{listingId}/...`.

`store-assets`:
- Public bucket.
- Max file size: 5 MB.
- Allowed MIME types: JPEG, PNG, WebP.
- Public select and insert policies.
- Store registration uploads logo and banner to `pending/{storeId}/...`.
- Phase 2 adds authenticated owner-folder upload support for future paths like `{auth.uid()}/{storeId}/...`.

Tradeoff: buckets are public. Moderation controls public app visibility through database status, not private object access.
Legacy public upload policies remain in place until the current unauthenticated forms are replaced.

## Indexes and Metadata

Important listing indexes include:
- `listings_status_idx`
- `listings_seller_type_idx`
- `listings_store_id_idx`
- `listings_category_idx`
- `listings_brand_idx`
- `listings_city_idx`
- `listings_price_pen_idx`
- `listings_created_at_idx`
- `listings_instrument_type_idx`
- `listings_published_at_idx`
- `listings_view_count_idx`
- `listings_attributes_gin_idx`
- `listings_search_idx`

`attributes` uses a GIN index because advanced filters rely on JSONB containment.

## Migrations

Current migrations:
- `20260427195000_initial_marketplace_schema.sql`: base tables, enums, indexes, triggers, RLS.
- `20260427202000_listing_photo_storage.sql`: `listing-photos` bucket and policies.
- `20260427203000_store_registration_fields.sql`: store fields, `store-assets` bucket and policies, pending free store insert policy.
- `20260427204000_store_verification.sql`: `is_verified`.
- `20260503120000_listing_marketplace_metadata.sql`: `instrument_type`, `attributes`, `published_at`, `view_count`, indexes.
- `20260503233000_increment_listing_view_count.sql`: view count RPC.
- `20260516180000_phase_2_accounts.sql`: profiles, store members, ownership columns, lifecycle fields, account RLS helpers, owner/member RLS policies, publication validation RPC, and authenticated owner-folder storage policies.

Production history note:
- The six pre-Phase-2 migrations describe the historical baseline that already existed in production. Earlier schema work was originally applied manually in Supabase SQL Editor, then Supabase migration history was repaired so the CLI would not replay those files.
- Do not re-apply old baseline migrations blindly against production. Use `supabase migration list` first and apply only pending migrations through the CLI or a carefully reviewed SQL path.
- `20260516180000_phase_2_accounts.sql` was applied to local Supabase and pushed to production through Supabase CLI during Phase 2 Ticket 2.

## Manual Migration Reminder

Vercel does not apply database migrations automatically.

When adding tables, columns, indexes, policies, RPCs, or storage buckets:
1. Create a migration file in `supabase/migrations`.
2. Review the SQL.
3. Prefer `supabase migration list` and `supabase db push` when the CLI is logged in and linked.
4. If using SQL Editor manually, verify migration history/state afterward so old migrations are not replayed later.
5. Deploy code only after production Supabase has the required schema.

## Future Tables Not Yet Implemented

Do not add these until explicitly requested:
- `favorites`
- `saved_searches`
- `seller_accounts`
- `featured_listing_orders`
- `store_plan_subscriptions`

These are useful future concepts, but adding them early would create operational complexity before Laria has enough supply, store participation, and buyer demand to justify account, billing, or marketplace mechanics.

## September 2026 reliability migration

`20260909120000_marketplace_performance.sql` adds an RLS-aware computed photo count, a service-only indexed email lookup, first-approval timestamps, bounded-browsing indexes, and atomic idempotent public submissions. See `docs/performance.md` for behavior and rollback-only verification.
